          The first thing to know about Final Fantasy is that the games are
          completely unconnected. If you want to play a specific game, there is
          no need to catch up, just go right in. However, if you're looking for
          a good starting point to get into the series in general, there are
          good cases to be made for almost every game, but there are three that
          stand out.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Final Fantasy X</li>
          <li>Final Fantasy IV</li>
          <li>Final Fantasy I</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The best choice is FFX. FFX is a good representation of
          the rest of the series because it has elements of every game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd prefer to start at the starting, FFIV is when the series
          really starts and is the first proper Final Fantasy game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to see the history of the series, you'll want to go all
          the way back to the first game. Be sure to play the ps1 version
          on psn for its music, graphics, and bugfixes. For FFII, play the gba
          or psp version for the psp extra content.
